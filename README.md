# Investigate a Dataset Project
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 2

## Overview
For this project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents my findings. I should start by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. I will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I should make it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that I am not looking for one right answer.

## What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python 3, plus the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use.
- Have practice communicating the results of my analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce plots showing my findings.
